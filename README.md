## Launch Pad Assignment

### Part 1

#### Assignment description

Make the serial moniter count down from 10 and print launch

#### Evidence

#### Wiring

No wiring for this assignment

#### Code

#### Reflection

This assignment was relativly easy because it was just hooking up the Pico to the comuter and having it print numbers. It took some time to think about how to make it count down rather than forward, but after some research and realizing I could move by negative incramates, it was pretty easy.

### Part 2

#### Assignment description

Make the countdown blink red every second it goes down and stay green after it launches using LEDs

#### Evidence

#### Code

[CODE CLICK HERE PLEASE PLEASER PLEAS](https://github.com/klenert17/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LED_Countdown.py)

#### Reflection

The hardest part of this assignment was the wiring. I have never wired a pico beofre and it was frustrating to not be able to see the number of which pin everything is going into all the time. After looking at the referance photo for the pins, I was able to wire it much easier. It was just two leds and two resistors, going into ground. 

### Part 3

#### Assignment description

Make the countodwn start after a button is pressed, with the LEDs lightingup for every second and holding green after liftoff

#### Evidence

#### Code

[PLEASE CLICK HERE FOR CODE PLEASE PLE$ASE PLEASE PLEASE](https://github.com/klenert17/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Countdown_Button.py)

#### Reflection

The code with this assignment was difficult because I had to remember how to use a button. After looking up some simple code and some of my old code, I was able to cobine parts to the previous part of this assignment and make it work. For wiring, I just connected the button to ground and to another GP pin.

### Part 4

#### Assignment description

We had to attach a servo to the pico, and make it urn 180 sgrees afet launch/10 seconds. 

#### Evidence

#### Code

[FINISHED CODE PLEASE CLICK PLEASE ITS GOOD I SAWR PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE](https://github.com/klenert17/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LaunchPad4.py)

#### Reflection

This assignment overall was pretty easy once I got back in the swing of coding. Wiring the servo was simple, and putting the code with it can pretty quickly. I had some trouble keeping track of which pins were which but I know I will get more used to it with practice.

## Raspberry_Pi_LED_Blink

### Assignment Description

For this assignment we had to make the LED on the PI board turn on and off indefinetly. This was to get us used to working with the PI for the first time.

### Evidence

### Code

[CODE HERE CLICK HERE!!!!!!](https://github.com/klenert17/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/LED_blink.py)

### Reflection

Most of this assignment was setting up VS Code to work with the Raspberry Pi, and setting it up for a new year. As this was the first code assignment of the year, I was a little bit rusty but this code was very easy. It really wasn't any different from any other LED Blink Assignment I had dome previously, and it was even easier because there was no wiring. Putting #type: ignore at the top was a really helpful piece of information because the red code lines are so annoying

## Raspberry_Pi_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here. You need to communicate what your thing does. 

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here. The diagram should be clear enough that I can recreate the wiring from scratch. 

### Code
Give me a link to your code. [Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py). Don't make me hunt through your folders, give me a nice link to click to take me there! Remember to **COMMENT YOUR CODE** if you want full credit. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document.
